									<h1>The Mysterious Pink Lake in Australia</h1>
									<p>A lake that remains pink regardless of the conditions, <br/>
										holding scientific mysteries and a legend about miraculous healing.</p>

								<p>Unlike other pink lakes, the color of Lake Hillier is always pink and does not change depending on weather or other conditions. The color remains constant even when the water is placed in a container! Like other pink lakes, it is believed that the pink color is caused by microorganisms such as Dunaliella salina and Halobacterium. They produce red pigments in salty environments.</p>
								<p>Although the lake is highly saline, the water is not harmful to humans, making it safe for swimming. However, due to its isolation, it is not easy to reach the lake.
									Lake Hillier is located on Middle Island in Western Australia and is surrounded by dense eucalyptus and tea tree forests, which further contribute to the color contrast between the lake and the surrounding nature.
									The best way to see Lake Hillier is from the air, as the lake looks incredible in combination with the nearby blue ocean.
									Although scientists know which microorganisms cause the pink color, the full reason for its intense persistence remains a mystery.</p>
								<h2>The Legend of the Lake</h2>
								<p>According to the legend, long ago, the sea washed ashore a sailor, the only survivor from a ship that had struck nearby rocks. He was alive, but in excruciating pain, every bone broken, starving, and begging for death just to escape the suffering. After a few days, on the edge of his strength, he cried out that he would sell his soul to the devil if only someone would ease his suffering.

									At that moment, a tall and thin man in earth-colored robes appeared before him, holding a jug of blood in one hand and a jug of milk in the other. He poured both liquids into a nearby pond, after which the water turned pink. He told the sailor that the blood would relieve him of pain and the milk would relieve him from hunger.

									The sailor crawled to the lake, submerged himself in the pink water, and when he emerged on the shore, he was no longer in pain and was full. He wanted to thank the stranger, but he vanished without a trace.

									Later, the sailor was rescued by a ship's crew that happened to pass by, and when he told them what had happened, they called the lake “the healer.”</p>
