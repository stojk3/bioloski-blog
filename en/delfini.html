									<h1>The Dark Side of Dolphins</h1>
									<p>With an intellect that even surpasses human intelligence, it's truly frightening what dolphins are capable of, <br/>
										and we may never fully know.</p>

								<p>Dolphins are aquatic mammals closely related to whales and porpoises. The Oceanic dolphin family also includes Orcas and some related species, so they can be considered dolphins. There are over 40 species of dolphins, ranging from 1.2 meters to 9.5 meters in length and weighing from 40 kg to 10 tons. Dolphins are carnivores and feed on smaller fish, squids, and other marine life.</p>
								<h2>Intelligence</h2>
								<p>Dolphins, one of the most intelligent animals in the world, come in second place, just after the most intelligent mice, one place above humans. With such intellect, it’s no wonder that dolphins sit at the top of the food chain in the ocean, even the most dangerous sharks are not their match. This is true for other marine animals, as dolphins have been observed multiple times helping and even saving humans from sharks, shipwrecks, and even tsunamis.</p>
								<h2>Personal Pleasures and Rape</h2>
								<p>Although considered extremely sociable and good-natured, what people aren’t aware of is that dolphins have a dark side. Scientists have proven that dolphins are among the rare animals, besides humans, who don’t mate solely for reproduction, but also for personal pleasure and bonding. In addition to consensual relationships, there have been numerous cases where dolphins have attempted or succeeded in raping humans, smaller fish, females of their species, and even other males.</p>
								<h2>Drug Use and Depression</h2>
								<p>Since pufferfish are mildly toxic, mimicking a psychedelic state in dolphins, they are known to intentionally inflate them and then play with them like balls, simultaneously poking their spikes and thus getting high. One particularly bizarre and tragic case occurred where a dolphin used for entertainment at Ocean World formed a close relationship with its keeper and mentor. When the mentor left and quit the job, the dolphin fell into a deep depression and intentionally committed suicide, a result of the deep depression caused by the abandonment of its caretaker.</p>
