									<h1>Polar Stratospheric Clouds</h1>
									<p>Rare, beautiful, and dangerous – polar stratospheric clouds hide secrets <br/>
										 that affect the fate of our ozone layer.</p>

								<p>Polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), also known as nacreous clouds due to their iridescent glow, form high in the atmosphere, in the stratosphere, at altitudes between 15 and 25 kilometers. These clouds are special because they form at extremely low temperatures below -78°C and mostly occur in polar regions during winter. Their appearance contributes to the formation of ozone holes, making them significant not only for their visual effect but also for their environmental impact.</p>

								<h2>How Do Polar Stratospheric Clouds Form?</h2>
								<p>PSCs form in polar regions when temperatures drop below the critical point in the stratosphere. They are composed of small ice particles and crystals of nitric acid and water. There are two main types of polar stratospheric clouds:</p>

										<ul>
											<li><strong>Type 1:</strong> Contains particles of nitric acid and contributes to chemical reactions that destroy ozone.</li>
											<li><strong>Type 2:</strong> Made up of pure ice crystals, and their glowing appearance is a result of light diffraction through these particles.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div>
								<h2>Impact on Ozone</h2>
								<p>One of the most important roles of PSCs is their connection to ozone destruction. Chemical reactions occurring on the surface of PSC crystals trigger the release of reactive chlorine molecules that break down the ozone layer. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in the spring when increased sunlight in polar regions activates these reactions.</p>
								<h2>Visual Phenomenon</h2>
								<p>In addition to their scientific significance, polar stratospheric clouds are recognized for their extraordinary beauty. These clouds are often iridescent, meaning they change color depending on the angle at which light passes through them. They appear in a spectrum of colors from pink and purple to gold and blue, and are most commonly seen at dawn or dusk when the sun’s rays strike the atmosphere at a certain angle. <br/>
								<br/>
								Polar stratospheric clouds are a fascinating natural phenomenon with significant implications for our planet. Their connection to ozone holes makes them important for understanding climate change, while their stunning appearance adds an element of beauty to the world of science. In the future, research on PSCs could help further our understanding of atmospheric processes and their environmental consequences.</p>
