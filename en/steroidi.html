									<h1>Steroids</h1>
									<p>Powerful and controversial – steroid hormones can enhance performance, <br/>
										 but their abuse carries serious risks.</p>

								<p>Steroid hormones are natural or synthetic compounds that play a key role in various biological processes in the body. They are divided into different types such as corticosteroids, which regulate immune responses and metabolism, and anabolic steroids, which are most commonly used to increase muscle mass and strength. The use of anabolic steroids is often associated with athletes and bodybuilders, but is also present among recreational users. While they can have positive effects on physical performance, steroids carry health risks, including negative consequences for the liver, heart, and endocrine system.</p>
								<h2>How Do Steroids Work?</h2>
								<p>Steroid hormones work by binding to specific receptors in cells. Anabolic steroids stimulate protein synthesis, which leads to increased muscle mass and improved physical ability. Corticosteroids, on the other hand, have anti-inflammatory properties and are used to reduce inflammation and treat autoimmune diseases. Due to their powerful effects, steroids are often prescribed under strict medical supervision.</p>

										<ul>
											<li><strong>Corticosteroids:</strong> Used for medical purposes to reduce inflammation and treat allergic and autoimmune conditions.</li>
											<li><strong>Anabolic Steroids:</strong> Composed of synthetic hormones similar to testosterone, anabolic steroids are used to increase muscle mass and strength.</li>
										</ul>
									</div>
								</div></p>
								<h2>Risks and Consequences</h2>
								<p>The use of steroids, especially anabolic steroids, is associated with numerous health risks. Prolonged use can cause serious problems such as liver damage, cardiovascular diseases, and hormonal imbalances. In men, it can lead to a reduction in natural testosterone production, while in women, it can cause the development of unwanted characteristics such as increased body hair. Due to these risks, inappropriate or irresponsible use of steroids is very dangerous to health.</p>
								<h2>Impact on Physical Endurance and Appearance</h2>
								<p>Steroids are known for their potential to enhance physical endurance and accelerate muscle growth. However, due to their effects on hormones, they can also cause changes in appearance, such as acne, hair loss, and increased fat tissue. Many anabolic steroid users seek these effects for aesthetic goals, but often ignore the possible long-term consequences.</p>
								&nbsp
								<p>Steroids represent a powerful tool in medicine, but their abuse in sports and recreational activities carries serious risks. It is necessary to carefully explore all consequences before use, in consultation with experts. While they may bring temporary results in terms of appearance and physical performance, in the long term, steroid abuse can lead to irreversible health damage and hormonal imbalance.</p>
